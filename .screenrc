# (may not work on older versions of screen)
# "layout autosave on" works only for explicitly named layouts in .screenrc.
# Namely, if you specified some layout as ABC, switched to it within Screen
# session and detached, this last layout will be restored after the session is
# resumed. If you did not specify any layout in the configuration file, you
# have to run internal command "layout save your_layout_name" before detaching.
